## The Rules!

CaveTeam is a *collaborative* game. The aim is to work together as a **CAVE TEAM** to escape the **DANGEROUS CAVE** while avoiding the **DEADLY SLIME**!

Teams can be up to 6 players.

## How To Play

* Play takes place on a **hexagonal grid**.
* Players are attemping to reach the **Cave Exit**.
* The **threshold** is (Number of Players * 3).

### Movement

1. All players start on the starting tile.
1. *Optional:* A player may move to any **clear path** tile along an unbroken path.
1. The player attempts to move to an adjacent tile - which can be a **clear path** or a **numbered tile**.
   1. The player rolls the dice. Regardless of whether the tile they want to move to is clear or not.
   1. If the score on the dice is **greater** than the score on the tile - the way is *clear!* Place a **clear path** token on the tile, and move the player onto the tile.
   1. If the score on the dice is **lower or equal** than to score on the tile - the way is *blocked!* Place a **blocked path** token on the tile. No one can land on this tile.
1. Players can occupy the same tile.

### Difficult Tiles

1. Some tiles are *impossible* for a single player to clear.
1. A player may ask a *group of players* for assistance.
1. The player may only ask players who are adjacent to the tile they wish to attempt.
1. The player must say in advance how many players are going to assist them.
1. Each player then rolls the dice.  
    1. If the *total* of all the rolls are *greater than* the score of the tile, the way is cleared.
    1. Place a **clear token** on the tile.
    1. The lead player moves onto the tile, all their assistants stay in place.

### Slime

1. Every roll of the dice, add the value of the roll to the **Slime Score!**
1. If the **Slime Score** reaches or exceeds the **threshold**, it is time to roll the **Slime Dice!**
   1. Any tile which is *adjacent* to the **Slime** *and* matches the number on the **Slime Dice** now becomes slime!
   1. The slime will spread to *all* adjoining groups of tiles which have that number.
   1. If the slime is adjacent to a **clear path** it will occupy the tile - no matter which number is rolled.
   1. If the slime touches a player, they are *out of the game!* Remove their character from the board and mourn their loss.

### Escape!

1. In order to escape, a *group of players* must be adjacent to the **Escape** tile.
1. The group of players must roll *over* the **Threshold**.
1. Any player who takes part in the group roll will escape.
1. Any players who do not take part in the group roll must continue play.
