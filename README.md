## About

CaveTeam is a *collaborative* game. The aim is to work together as a **CAVE TEAM** to escape the **DANGEROUS CAVE** while avoiding the **DEADLY SLIME**!

### Unique Features

* Collaborative - play as a team.
* Simple rules - learn in 5 minutes.
* Roguelike - your team may get wiped out quickly.
* Quick - games typically take 20 minutes.
* Infinite combination of boards - generate new ones instantly.
* Variable difficulty - once you've played a few times, you can make the game harder or easier.

## How To Play

* Play takes place on a **Hexagonal Grid**.
* Players are attemping to reach the **Cave Exit**.
* The **Threshold** is (Number of Players * 3).

### The Board

* Each cave tile has a difficulty score.
* Once a tile has been cleared, its difficulty score becomes 0.
* All players start on the starting tile.

### Movement

1. *Optional:* The player may move to any adjacent **clear path** tile without rolling the dice.
1. The player must then attempt to move to another adjacent tile - which can be a **clear path** or a **numbered tile**.
   1. The player rolls the dice. Regardless of whether the tile they want to move to is clear or not.
   1. If the score on the dice is **greater** than the score on the tile - the way is *clear!*
      * Place a **clear path** token on the tile, and move the player onto the tile.
   1. If the score on the dice is **lower or equal** than the score on the tile - the way is *blocked!*
      * Place a **blocked path** token on the tile. No one can land on this tile.
1. It is now the next player's turn.

### Difficult Tiles

* Some tiles are *impossible* for a single player to clear.
* A player may ask a *group of players* for assistance.
  * The player may only ask others who are *adjacent* to the tile they wish to attempt.
  * The player must say in advance how many of the others are going to assist them.
  * Other players *may* refuse to assist. *This may incur real-world ramifications.*

1. Each player then rolls the dice.  
    1. If the *total* of all the rolls are *greater than* the score of the tile, the way is *clear!*
      * Place a **clear token** on the tile.
      * The lead player moves onto the tile, all their assistants stay in place.
    1. If the *total* of all the rolls are *less than or equal to* to score of the tile, the way is *blocked!*
      * Place a **blocked path** token on the tile.

### Slime

1. Every roll of the dice, add the value of the roll to the **Slime Score!**
1. If the **Slime Score** reaches or exceeds the **threshold**, it is time to roll the **Slime Dice!**
   1. Any tile which is *adjacent* to the **Slime** *and* matches the number on the **Slime Dice** now becomes slime!
   1. The slime will spread to *all* adjoining groups of tiles which have that number.
   1. If the slime is adjacent to a **clear path** it will occupy the tile - no matter which number is rolled.
   1. If the slime touches a player, they are *out of the game!*
      * Remove their character from the board and mourn their loss.
1. Once the slime dice has been rolled, the **Slime Score** resets to 0.

### Escape!

1. In order to escape, a *group of players* must be adjacent to the **Escape** tile.
1. The group of players must roll *over* the **Threshold**.
1. Any player who takes part in the group roll will escape.
1. Any players who do not take part in the group roll must continue play.
1. You may choose to sacrifice some players in order to make your escape. *This may incur real-world ramifications.*

### Misc

* The youngest player goes first.
* Players may *not* pass.
* Multiple players can occupy the same tile.
* Slime cannot occupy a **blocked path**. Hint! This could be a useful tactic.
* Players are expected to confer with each other on tactics. Players may ignore others' suggestions.

## Difficulty

On some boards, you may die very quickly. Some may be impossible to complete. Some will be completed quickly and easily.  Here are some tips to vary the difficulty for experienced players.

* Increase the board size.
* Multiple slime tiles.
* Roll the Slime Dice multiple times.
* Decrease the Threshold.
* Remove the optional free move.
